rem ============================================================
rem  Qingframe dev launcher.
rem
rem  IMPORTANT: keep this file ASCII-only.
rem  cmd parses .bat bytes using the console codepage. A UTF-8 Chinese
rem  .bat gets read as GBK, a double-byte lead byte then swallows the
rem  following character, and the rest of the line is executed as a
rem  command. We hit exactly that:
rem      '<chinese word>' is not recognized as an internal or external command
rem  Chinese messages therefore come from Node (src/main/index.js), which
rem  prints correctly because chcp 65001 is set above.
rem  Consequence: never grep the log for the Chinese single-instance
rem  message - grep for the ASCII markers only.
rem
rem  WHY software GL is the default
rem  -----------------------------
rem  The hardware path dies at startup on this machine with exit code
rem  -2147483645 == 0x80000003 == STATUS_BREAKPOINT. Chromium raises that
rem  from LOG(FATAL) via __debugbreak when the GPU process cannot be used,
rem  so the whole app dies before the renderer starts and start.log ends up
rem  with no Electron output at all (the crash lands before stderr flushes).
rem
rem  Measured here:
rem    electron .                                   -> STATUS_BREAKPOINT, dead
rem    electron . --disable-gpu                     -> STILL dead; Electron 31
rem       still spawns the GPU process anyway. Do not "simplify" back to it.
rem    electron . --use-gl=swiftshader --no-sandbox -> window comes up, stable.
rem
rem  THE SINGLE-INSTANCE LOCK
rem  -----------------------
rem  Chromium takes a 0-byte lock file, %APPDATA%\qingframe-web\lockfile:
rem  created on launch, deleted on exit. If it cannot create it, Chromium
rem  reports
rem      process_singleton_win.cc(465) Lock file can not be created!
rem      Error code: 5            (5 = ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED)
rem  app.requestSingleInstanceLock() then returns false, so the app prints
rem  its own "already running" warning too. That warning is a SYMPTOM, not
rem  the cause: :classify therefore tests the Chromium line FIRST and only
rem  then the app's refusal line. Testing them the other way round reports
rem  "another instance owns the lock" and skips the recovery below, which is
rem  exactly the bug this comment exists to prevent.
rem
rem  This failure is intermittent: the same command from the same account
rem  failed and then worked 31 seconds later. The profile directory is
rem  writable (a 0-byte file with the real name can be created there at any
rem  time), holds no stale lock, and no leftover electron.exe was running, so
rem  the cause is a transient handle on that lock file. Rather than guess,
rem  :recover_lock removes the stale file and retries exactly once - safe
rem  because the guard (no live electron.exe) is checked first, and safe to
rem  retry because a rejected attempt never started anything. Contrast with
rem  the GPU crash, which must NOT be retried: that process is still tearing
rem  down and its retry loses the lock race.
rem
rem  Structure notes, both learned the hard way:
rem    - each launch is its own label, not an if/else block, because a '>'
rem      inside parentheses needs no escaping and escaping it with '^'
rem      silently turns the redirect into a literal argument to npm.
rem    - each mode stores its flags in %FLAGS% and captures %errorlevel%
rem      immediately, because 'goto' is not guaranteed to preserve it.
rem    - %RETRIED% guards the single retry so :classify cannot loop.
rem
rem  MODES
rem    (default)                 software GL, normal profile
rem    QINGFRAME_HW=1            hardware GPU (currently crashes)
rem    QINGFRAME_FRESH_PROFILE=1 software GL + empty profile. Last-resort
rem                                escape hatch; saved templates and
rem                                state.json will NOT be visible there.
rem  To see the raw error that start.log swallows, run in a plain cmd window:
rem    node_modules\.bin\electron.cmd . --enable-logging
